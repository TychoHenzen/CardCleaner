# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CardCleaner is a Godot 4.4+ game built with C# (.NET 8.0) featuring a card-based deckbuilder with procedural world generation. Cards have an 8-dimensional "signature" system representing elemental properties that influence gameplay, combat, and loot generation.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run all tests (requires Godot runtime)
dotnet test

# Run tests with verbose output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# Run a specific test class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CardSignatureTest"

# Run the whole gdUnit suite the way CI does (Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7)
powershell -NoProfile -File Scripts/ci/Run-GdUnit.ps1 -GodotBinary <path to Godot_v4.7.1-stable_mono_win64.exe>

# Only the [TestCategory("Unit")] suites, as CI runs on pull requests
powershell -NoProfile -File Scripts/ci/Run-GdUnit.ps1 -GodotBinary <path to Godot exe> -Fast
```

Tests use gdUnit4 framework and require the Godot runtime (`[RequireGodotRuntime]` attribute). Test files are in `Tests/` mirroring the `Scripts/` structure.

gdUnit finds a C# suite by its file name, so a `[TestSuite]` class must be named after its file (`TestSuiteNamingTest` enforces this). `Run-GdUnit.ps1` fails when a `[TestSuite]` file never runs. When Godot prints nothing for `-StallSeconds` (180 by default) it kills Godot, names the suite it stalled in, and reruns only the unfinished suites (at most `-MaxResumes` times); a second stall in the same place fails the run. Reports and logs go to `reports/ci`.

## Code Style

The project uses `.editorconfig` for code style enforcement with Godot-specific adaptations:

- **Naming Conventions**: Interfaces prefixed with `I`, private fields with `_camelCase`, public members use `PascalCase`
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Enabled project-wide at warning level (CS8600-CS8625 series)
- **Modern C# Features**: File-scoped namespaces, pattern matching, primary constructors encouraged
- **Godot Lifecycle Exceptions**:
  - CA1051 disabled (allows public fields for `[Export]` attributes)
  - CA2000/CA1816 relaxed (Godot manages node lifecycle)
  - CA1031 lenient (game code exception handling)
- **Tests/Addons**: Tests have relaxed null checking; addons folder has all analyzers disabled

### [Tool] Attribute Usage

The `[Tool]` attribute causes Godot to execute scripts in the editor. **Only use `[Tool]` on scripts that genuinely need editor functionality:**

**WHEN TO USE `[Tool]`:**
- Resources with `[GlobalClass]` that are edited in the inspector
- Nodes with editor preview features (e.g., `GeneratePreview` button)
- Editor plugins and custom inspectors

**WHEN NOT TO USE `[Tool]`:**
- Runtime-only nodes (interaction, physics, game logic)
- Components that only run during gameplay
- Services and controllers

**The Problem:** `[Tool]` scripts run `_Ready()` in the editor, which populates private fields. Godot then serializes these runtime values to `.tscn` files, causing:
- Private fields like `_rng`, `_originalPosition` appearing in scene files
- Version control noise from random state changes
- Potential deserialization bugs

**The Fix:** Remove `[Tool]` from runtime-only scripts. If `[Tool]` is truly needed, guard `_Ready()`:

```csharp
public override void _Ready()
{
    if (Engine.IsEditorHint()) return;
    // Runtime initialization...
}
```

### Export Default Preservation (Inspector Reset Button)

The `_PropertyCanRevert()` pattern enables the "reset to default" button in the Godot inspector. Note: this does NOT prevent serialization - it only affects the inspector UI.

```csharp
public partial class MyNode : Node3D
{
    private const float DefaultSpeed = 5.0f;
    [Export] public float Speed = DefaultSpeed;

    public override bool _PropertyCanRevert(StringName property)
    {
        return property.ToString() == nameof(Speed) || base._PropertyCanRevert(property);
    }

    public override Variant _PropertyGetRevert(StringName property)
    {
        return property.ToString() == nameof(Speed)
            ? DefaultSpeed
            : base._PropertyGetRevert(property);
    }
}
```

**When to use**: For exported properties where you want the inspector's reset button to work correctly.

## Architecture

### Dependency Injection

The project uses a custom service locator pattern integrated with Godot's autoload system:

- **ServiceLocator** (`Scripts/Core/DependencyInjection/ServiceLocator.cs`): Godot autoload node registered as "Services" that manages the DI container
- **ServiceContainer**: Supports singleton, transient, and factory registrations
- **IServiceProvider**: Nodes implementing this interface and added to the `service_providers` group will have their services registered at startup
- Services can use async resolution via `ServiceLocator.Get<T>(callback)` for services not yet registered

Access services via `ServiceLocator.Get<T>()` or `ServiceLocator.Container.Resolve<T>()`.

### Card Signature System

The core mechanic uses `CardSignature` - an 8-dimensional vector with values clamped to [-1, 1] representing elemental properties:

| Index | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Solidum | Solidity (air-rock) |
| 1 | Febris | Temperature (water-fire) |
| 2 | Ordinem | Orderedness (entropy-order) |
| 3 | Lumines | Luminance (dark-light) |
| 4 | Varias | Manifold (time-space) |
| 5 | Inertiae | Density (heavy-light) |
| 6 | Subsidium | Helpfulness (harmful-helpful) |
| 7 | Spatium | Distance (nearby-distant) |

Signatures influence card generation, combat calculations, map generation parameters, and loot drops.

### World Generation

> **Architecture Document**: See `docs/WORLDGEN_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the complete worldgen architecture, including the Soft WFC approach, weight modifier system, and data definition guides.

**Active System**: Two-Phase WFC via **SimpleMapGenerator** (`Scripts/Features/Deckbuilder/Services/SimpleMapGenerator.cs`)

The map generator uses a **two-phase Wave Function Collapse** approach with dual-layer terrain:

1. **Background Layer (Phase 1)**: WFC generates simple (non-auto-tile) terrain tiles
   - Gap tiles fill the entire map with biome-influenced probability
   - Creates the base visual layer seen through gaps in foreground terrain

2. **Foreground Layer (Phase 2)**: WFC generates auto-tile terrain with gap constraints
   - `AutoTileGapConstraint` enforces 1-tile gaps between different auto-tile types (8-way check)
   - Gap tiles (non-auto-tiles) separate auto-tile regions, eliminating bitmask conflicts
   - Dual-grid rendering samples 4 data corners per visual tile; gap constraint ensures at most one auto-tile type per 2x2 window

3. **Merge**: Foreground takes precedence where present; background shows through gaps

**Key Files** (all in `Scripts/Features/Worldgen/Wfc/`):
- `WfcMapGenerator.cs`: High-level generator that configures and runs WFC
- `WfcSolver.cs`: Core WFC algorithm (cell selection, collapse, propagation)
- `WfcPropagator.cs`: Constraint propagation using adjacency rules
- `WfcTileSelector.cs`: Weighted tile selection with soft constraints
- `Constraints/AutoTileGapConstraint.cs`: Prevents adjacent different auto-tiles (hard constraint)
- `Constraints/SpatialCoherenceConstraint.cs`: Encourages contiguous tile regions

**CRITICAL - WFC Soft Constraints and Entropy**:
- **Tiles are NOT removed from possibility sets** - constraints set weights to 0 instead
- `cell.GetPossibleTiles().Count` is MEANINGLESS for entropy - it includes 0-weight tiles
- Entropy MUST be calculated using weighted probabilities from constraint evaluation
- **DO NOT** try to optimize cell selection by counting tiles - this breaks WFC completely
- Any entropy optimization must preserve full constraint weight calculation

**Dual-Grid Auto-Tiling**:
- Visual tiles offset by half a cell from data grid
- Each visual tile samples 4 data corners → 4-bit bitmask (Corner16 format)
- The gap constraint ensures each visual tile sees at most ONE auto-tile type
- `Dominance` property on tiles determines which terrain renders "on top"

**Gradient Systems**:
- `CardBasedGradient`: Creates gradients from input cards (sphere/capsule/Bezier)
- `RadialGradient`: Center-to-edge signature blending
- `NoiseGradient`: FastNoiseLite-based variation
- Gradients influence biome selection via `BiomeAffinityConstraint`

### Game Session Flow

The `GameSessionService` manages the game loop through states: `WaitingForCards` → `GeneratingMap` → `Exploring` → `InCombat` → `GeneratingLoot` → `SessionComplete`. Key supporting systems:

- **SimpleMapGenerator**: Creates tile-based maps influenced by card signatures
- **ExplorationAI**: A* pathfinding for autonomous exploration
  - Operates in two modes: `FrontierExploration` and `PathToEnemy`
  - Emits events for path updates, visited tiles, player movement, and enemy encounters
- **FrontierExplorationBehavior**: Intelligent exploration using frontier expansion
  - Tracks seen vs. visited tiles using visibility checking
  - Automatically marks trivially visible tiles as visited
- **IVisibilityChecker**: Interface for line-of-sight calculations with configurable vision range (default 5)
- **SimpleCombatSystem**: Turn-based combat using card signatures

**Debug Visualization**: Overlay layer system allows non-destructive visualization of exploration data (current path, target tile, visited tiles).

**Key Exploration Events**: `PathUpdated`, `VisitedTilesUpdated`, `PlayerMoved`, `EnemyEncountered`, `EnemySpotted`

### Persistence

Uses the Saveable addon (`addons/saveable/`) with Newtonsoft.Json. Implement `ISaveable` interface with `UniqueID`, `Load(NodeSave)`, and `Save(NodeSave)` methods. The `GameSaveService` handles auto-saving of game state.

### Feature Organization

Code is organized by feature under `Scripts/Features/`:
- **Card/**: Card models, controllers, components, and services (spawning, generation)
- **Deckbuilder/**: Game session management, map generation, combat, exploration
- **Worldgen/**: Procedural generation support (auto-tiling, biomes, gradients, blob generation)
- **Player/**: Player controller and interaction system
- **Packs/**: Card containers the player opens (box of 8 packs, pack of 8 boosters, booster of 8 cards); `CardPackGenerator` makes each card special with probability 1/512 and special cards show their signature along the card edges
- **Conveyor/**: Conveyor belt mechanics
- **Portal/**: Backoffice wall seam that opens to a doorway and teleports the player (pure rules in `Models/`)
- **Pause/**: Pause menu controller

Core utilities and interfaces are in `Scripts/Core/`.

## Canonical dod-guard Workflow

- `/add-backlog-idea` creates an issue in **Backlog**.
- `/refine-backlog-item` researches the issue and moves it to **Todo** when it is ready.
- `/next-ticket` implements exactly one issue on one issue branch.
- `/submit-draft-pr` publishes the branch as a draft pull request.
- Review remains read-only until the user explicitly accepts the findings or requests remediation.
- `/complete-pr` owns the ready-to-merge check, merge, linked-issue confirmation, and remote branch deletion.

### Private Assets Submodule

All art and models live in the private repo `TychoHenzen/cardcleaner-assets`, a git submodule mounted at `Assets/` (so `res://Assets/...` resolves there). It holds the former `Graphics/` folder as `Assets/Graphics/`, the Synty files in `Assets/Synty/`, the card, terrain and material resources, and the Godot `.import` files (tracked there so UIDs stay stable). It does not use Git LFS (about 75 MB, no file over 5 MB); revisit if a single file passes 50 MB.

- Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or run `git submodule update --init` in an existing clone. An empty `Assets/` means the submodule is not initialised.
- Changing an asset is two commits: commit and push inside `Assets/` first, then commit the updated `Assets` pointer in this repo. Pushing the pointer before the submodule commit breaks CI.
- CI fetches the submodule with the read-only deploy key in the `ASSETS_DEPLOY_KEY` secret (`.github/actions/checkout-assets`).
- `Z:\Tycho\Projects\Assets` is our internal asset collection. Whenever new assets are needed, look there first. The Synty packs are under `Z:\Tycho\Projects\Assets\CardCleanerAssets` (mostly zips; extract one into the sync script's source root, `../CardCleanerAssets` or `CARDCLEANER_ASSET_SOURCE`, before listing its files in `tools/synty-assets.json`).

### Shop Scene and Licensed Assets

`Scenes/Gameplay/ShopScene.tscn` is the graybox shop (storefront, storage, backoffice). Launch it directly (editor F6); `StartScene.tscn` stays the main scene. Wall, floor, door and counter art comes from the licensed Synty packs. Only the files listed in the manifest are committed, and only in the private submodule, never in this repo:

- To add Synty files, list them in `tools/synty-assets.json`, run `tools/sync-assets.ps1`, open the project in Godot so it imports the FBX files, then commit the new files and their `.import` files inside `Assets/`. The script copies into `Assets/Synty/`. Set `CARDCLEANER_ASSET_SOURCE` to override the source root (default `../CardCleanerAssets`). A missing root, file or uninitialised submodule is an error.
- Each shop issue adds its own manifest entries.
- `ShopArtSlot` nodes load a pack mesh at runtime and hide their graybox placeholder. Without the import the scene still loads and shows the placeholders. Collision is hand-authored and independent of the art.

### Backoffice PC Ordering

The PC in the shop backoffice (`World/Markers/PcLocation/PcTerminal`, a child of the PC marker, an `OrderTerminal`) opens an ordering screen (`OrderTerminalUi`) for the `OrderCatalog` assigned to its `Catalog` export (`Data/Shop/BackofficeCatalog.tres`). Ordering uses `IMoneyService` (balance, `TrySpend`) and `IOrderingService`, both nodes under the scene's `Services` provider. A successful order deducts the price and instances the item scene (`Scenes/Shop/Items/*.tscn`) at the `DeliveryPoint` marker, in a grid of slots that never overlap. To sell different items elsewhere (for example a workshop terminal), add an `OrderTerminal`, an `OrderTerminalUi` and a new `OrderCatalog` resource; no code changes. While the screen is open `PlayerController.ControlEnabled` is false and the cursor is visible; closing it (button or Escape) restores both. The starting balance is `MoneyService.StartingBalance`; the balance is not saved.

### Selling Cards at the Register

The shop's checkout counter (`World/Storefront/CheckoutCounter`, a `SaleRegister`) sells one card per interaction: the card the player is holding (`PlayerHolder`), otherwise a card on the nearest shelf. A label above the counter shows the balance and the last result. Shelf scenes (`Scenes/Shop/Items/Shelf.tscn`, a `CardShelf`) have three one-card `DeckSlot` slots: drop a card on a slot to stock it, pick it up to take it back. `CardShelf` joins the `card_shelves` group, so shelves ordered at the PC need no wiring. `CardPricing.GetPrice` is the pure price function: every card sells for `FixedCardPrice` (special-card pricing is out of scope). `CardSale.TrySell` pays into `IMoneyService`, frees the card and refuses a second sale of the same card. `DeckSlot` only locks `CardController` bodies, so ordered boxes are ignored. The shop scene has the card services and a `CardSpawner` (keys 1, 2, 3) so cards can be spawned for testing.

### Workshop

The workshop (`Scenes/Components/Workshop.tscn`, instanced in `ShopScene.tscn`) is one 40 x 40 m warehouse: the cabinet room in the centre, a 3.2 m hallway or hall leaving each of its sides, ordering rooms (order office, delivery bay) to the west and build rooms to the east. The backoffice seam (a `PortalDoorway`, `Scenes/Portal/PortalDoorway.tscn`) leads to `WorkshopEntry`; the always-open `ReturnSeam` on the cabinet room's south wall leads back to `World/Markers/ShopReturn`.

The walls are a 0.2 m `GridMap` (`WorkshopGrid`) baked from the spec in `Scripts/Features/Workshop/Models/WorkshopHallLayout.cs`. To change the layout, edit the spec, then press "Bake Layout" on the `WorkshopGrid` node in the inspector and save the scene; `WorkshopGridSceneContractTest` fails while the baked cells differ from the spec. Section markers under `WorkshopGrid/Sections` carry each room's sign and light.

The cabinet, holders, button and wires are `Scenes/Workshop/CabinetAssembly.tscn`, shared by the workshop's cabinet and the orderable `ArcadeCabinet`. The map screens stay on the workshop cabinet only, because they are wired to its `DeckbuilderController`.
